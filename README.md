## My Story

I started building websites in 2005 when I was working for Chicago International Trucks.

After working for an AD agency my confidence grew and I began designing and developing sites with Adobe products like PhotoShop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver.

Having a few years under my belt, I went full-time with my business. It was HARD, but I learned so many good things about people, expectations, and wearing many hats as a business owner.

I am self-taught and ALWAYS eager to learn new things.  I am an extrovert by nature and enjoy troubleshooting complex problems with many people to find innovative solutions.
