## My Story

Art is something I enjoy. I was going to teach art classes to elementary children, but after I student taught, that belief flew out the window.

I started building websites in 2005 when I was working for Chicago International Trucks. [^1]

After working for an AD agency my confidence grew and I began designing and developing sites with Adobe products like PhotoShop and Dreamweaver.

Having a few years under my belt, I went full-time with my business. It was HARD, but I learned so many good things about people, expectations, and wearing many hats.

I am self-taught and always eager to learn new things.  I am an extrovert by nature and enjoy troubleshooting complex problems with many people to find innovative solutions. 

I’ve been quoted as saying:*
> “Don’t ask me to do something if you don’t expect it to get done.”
